# Implementing Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
Linear regression is the technique in which we are going to estimate the value of a target variable based on a random input using the given set of values of independent and the correspondent target variables. Here we are going to use a single independent variable to estimate the prediction function.

## Estimation of the prediction fucntion using Gradient Descent

The prediction function that we are going to use in this case is as follows:<br/>

Y=Theta0+(Theta1*X)<br/>
